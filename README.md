#**AI-POWERED STUDY BUDDY**

The AI Powered Study Buddy is a digital learning assistant powered by AI that works over the internet to be the most helpful for students in the comprehension of academic concepts, the effectiveness of revision, and the smoothness of the study plan organization. The app is created using Python and Streamlit which not only provides a neat interface but also allows students to engage interactively with the system by giving out as input topics, notes, or explanations, and it will then provide instantaneously the relevant response. The app has incorporated a large language model through the Hugging Face Inference API which ensures the delivery of easy-to-understand explanations, summarization answers, quizzes, and study plans customized to the students’ needs. The project aspires to reduce the hassle of learning and enlighten the concept through the use of active learning techniques such as self-explanation, revision, and self-assessment. The project does not incorporate any databases and thus no user data making it light and easy to deploy in the educational setting. To put it briefly, the project is a not only personalized digital study partner but also a learning-efficient booster and academic preparation assistant for students.
